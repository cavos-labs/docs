description: "Create and manage Cavos apps programmatically using API keys"
---

## Overview

The Management API lets you create Cavos apps directly from your backend, CI/CD pipeline, or any HTTP client — without going through the dashboard.

All requests authenticate with an **API key** scoped to a specific organization.

<Note>
  API keys are generated from your organization settings in the [Dashboard](https://cavos.xyz/dashboard). Each key is shown **only once** at creation and cannot be recovered.
</Note>

---

## Authentication

Include your API key as a Bearer token in every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer cav_your_api_key_here
```

**Key format:** `cav_` followed by 48 URL-safe characters.

<Warning>
  API keys are scoped to a single organization. A key for org A cannot create apps in org B.
</Warning>

## Endpoints

### Create an App

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://cavos.xyz/api/v1/apps \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cav_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My App",
    "organization_id": "your-org-uuid",
    "description": "Optional description"
  }'
```

```typescript Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://cavos.xyz/api/v1/apps', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer cav_your_api_key_here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'My App',
    organization_id: 'your-org-uuid',
    description: 'Optional description',
  }),
});

const { app } = await response.json();
console.log(app.id); // use this app ID with the Cavos SDK
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://cavos.xyz/api/v1/apps',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer cav_your_api_key_here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    json={
        'name': 'My App',
        'organization_id': 'your-org-uuid',
        'description': 'Optional description',
    }
)

app = response.json()['app']
print(app['id'])
```

</CodeGroup>

**Endpoint**

```
POST https://cavos.xyz/api/v1/apps
```

**Request body**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Display name for the app |
| `organization_id` | string (UUID) | Yes | The org this app belongs to — must match the API key's org |
| `description` | string | No | Optional description |

**Success response** — `201 Created`

```json
{
  "app": {
    "id": "3f7a9b2e-...",
    "name": "My App",
    "description": "Optional description",
    "organization_id": "your-org-uuid",
    "is_active": true,
    "created_at": "2026-02-13T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

The returned `app.id` is the **App ID** you pass to the Cavos SDK (`appId` in `CavosProvider`).

## Error Reference

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `400` | — | Missing or invalid fields (`name` or `organization_id`) |
| `401` | — | Missing, malformed, or revoked API key |
| `403` | — | API key doesn't have access to the requested organization |
| `404` | — | Organization not found |
| `429` | — | App limit reached for your plan (see below) |
| `500` | — | Internal server error |

**Example error responses**

```json 401 Invalid key
{ "error": "Invalid or revoked API key" }
```

```json 403 Wrong org
{ "error": "API key does not have access to this organization" }
```

```json 429 Limit reached
{
  "error": "App limit reached for your plan",
  "tier": "developer",
  "limit": 10,
  "current": 10
}
```

---

## Plan Limits

App creation limits apply per user account, across all their organizations.

| Plan | App Limit |
|------|-----------|
| Developer (free) | 10 apps |
| Growth | 30 apps |
| Scale | 100 apps |

Upgrade your plan from the [Billing page](https://cavos.xyz/dashboard/billing).

## Generating an API Key

1. Go to your [Dashboard](https://cavos.xyz/dashboard) and open an organization
2. Scroll to the **API Keys** section
3. Click **Generate Key** and give it a descriptive name (e.g. `"CI Pipeline"`)
4. Copy the key — it's shown **only once**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/api-keys-ui.png" alt="API Keys section in the organization dashboard" />
</Frame>

To revoke a key, click **Revoke** next to it in the dashboard. Revoked keys are rejected immediately.

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Store keys as environment variables">
    Never hardcode API keys in source code. Use environment variables or a secrets manager:

    ```bash
    # .env
    CAVOS_API_KEY=cav_your_api_key_here
    ```

    ```typescript
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.CAVOS_API_KEY}` }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use one key per service">
    Generate a separate key for each consumer (CI pipeline, backend service, etc.). This way you can revoke a single key without affecting others.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate keys periodically">
    Generate a new key, update your service, then revoke the old one. The API supports multiple active keys per organization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Never log or expose keys">
    Keys in logs, error messages, or frontend bundles are compromised. Treat them like passwords.
  </Accordion>
