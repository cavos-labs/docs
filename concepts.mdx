## Passkeys (WebAuthn)

Passkeys are a modern authentication standard that replaces passwords with device biometrics. When a user authenticates with Cavos:

1. The device generates a cryptographic key pair
2. The private key is stored securely in the device's secure enclave (TPM/Secure Element)
3. Authentication requires biometric verification (FaceID, TouchID, Windows Hello)

### Passkey Encryption

Cavos uses the WebAuthn PRF (Pseudo-Random Function) extension to derive an encryption key from the passkey. This key encrypts the wallet's private key:

- **At rest**: Private key is encrypted with AES-GCM using the passkey-derived key
- **In use**: Private key is decrypted only after successful biometric authentication
- **Storage**: Encrypted private key is stored in the backend for cross-device recovery

### Benefits

- No passwords to remember or steal
- Phishing-resistant (bound to specific domains)
- Hardware-backed security
- Cross-device recovery via passkey sync (iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager)

## Gasless Transactions

Traditional blockchain transactions require users to hold the native token (ETH) to pay gas fees. Cavos eliminates this friction using **account abstraction** and **paymasters**.

### How It Works

1. User initiates a transaction
2. SDK builds the transaction and sends it to AVNU Paymaster
3. Paymaster sponsors the gas fee
4. Transaction is executed on-chain
5. User's wallet never needs to hold ETH

### AVNU Paymaster

Cavos uses AVNU's paymaster infrastructure. Each Cavos app receives:

- **Sepolia**: Shared paymaster (free for testing)
- **Mainnet**: Configurable paymaster with billing through Cavos dashboard

## Account Abstraction (AA)

Starknet has native account abstraction, meaning every account is a smart contract. Cavos wallets use the **ArgentX account contract**:

```
Account Class Hash: 0x036078334509b514626504edc9fb252328d1a240e4e948bef8d0c08dff45927f
```

### Account Features

- **Upgradeable**: Account logic can be upgraded
- **Guardian support**: Optional security guardian (disabled by default in Cavos)
- **Multi-call**: Execute multiple transactions atomically

### Deployment

Accounts are deployed lazily when first used. Cavos handles this automatically:

1. On wallet creation, the account address is computed deterministically
2. The account can receive funds before deployment
3. On first use (or automatically), the account is deployed via paymaster

## Authentication Flows

### OAuth + Passkey (Recommended)

Best for apps that want user identity:

```
User -> Google/Apple OAuth -> Identity Verified -> Passkey Registration -> Wallet Created
```

- User has a social identity (email, name)
- Wallet is linked to social account
- Recovery possible via same social login + passkey

### Passkey-Only (Anonymous)

Best for privacy-focused apps:

```
User -> Passkey Registration -> Anonymous Wallet Created
```

- No identity collection
- User is identified only by passkey
- Recovery via passkey sync (iCloud/Google)

## Network Support

| Network | Status | Paymaster |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Starknet Mainnet | Supported | AVNU (paid) |
| Starknet Sepolia | Supported | AVNU (free) |
