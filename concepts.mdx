## OAuth Wallets with JWT Verification

Cavos creates **self-custodial StarkNet wallets** tied to your OAuth identity (Google, Apple, or Firebase). Your wallet address is deterministically derived from your provider's user ID, ensuring the same account always gets the same wallet across devices.

### How It Works

    style E fill:#e6ffe6,stroke:#333
    style F fill:#ffe6e6,stroke:#333
    style G fill:#e6ffe6,stroke:#333
```

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Authenticates**: Login with Google, Apple, or Firebase email/password
2. **JWT Issued**: Provider returns a signed JWT token with user identity
3. **Ephemeral Key Generated**: SDK creates a temporary ECDSA keypair (Stark curve)
4. **Nonce Computation**: `nonce = Poseidon(ephemeralPubKey, maxBlock, randomness)`
5. **Address Derivation**: `addressSeed = Poseidon(sub, app_salt)` → deterministic wallet address
6. **On-Chain Verification**: Smart contract verifies JWT RSA signature and registers ephemeral key

### JWT Verification On-Chain

Unlike traditional session keys, Cavos uses **JWT signature verification** directly on-chain:

```typescript
// JWT contains:
{
  sub: "google-oauth2|123456",  // User ID from provider
  nonce: "0x...",                // Poseidon hash of ephemeral key
  iss: "https://accounts.google.com",
  aud: "your-client-id",
  exp: 1234567890
}
```

**On first transaction:**
- Contract verifies RSA-2048 signature of JWT
- Validates nonce matches ephemeral public key
- Registers ephemeral key for this session
- Executes transaction

**Subsequent transactions:**
- Signed with lightweight ephemeral key signature
- No need to re-verify full JWT
- Much cheaper gas cost

### Ephemeral Keys

Ephemeral keys are temporary signing keys that expire after a configured duration:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Lifetime** | ~24 hours (configurable via `sessionDuration`) |
| **Storage** | SessionStorage (cleared on browser close) |
| **Renewal** | Can generate new ephemeral key and re-register |
| **Revocation** | Automatic on expiry or manual logout |

**Key Differences from Session Keys:**
- No policy restrictions (full wallet control)
- Registered on-chain via JWT verification
- Expire based on block height, not timestamp
- Can be renewed during grace period

### Security Model

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **JWT Token** | Issued by OAuth provider, verified on-chain |
| **Ephemeral Key** | Generated client-side, registered via JWT |
| **Wallet Address** | Deterministically derived from OAuth `sub` claim |
| **Private Key** | Never stored - wallets are OAuth-based, not key-based |
| **Expiration** | Ephemeral keys expire after ~24 hours |
| **Renewal** | Generate new ephemeral key, verify with same JWT |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cavos wallets are **OAuth-based**, not private-key-based. Your identity (Google/Apple/Firebase account) IS your wallet. No seed phrases, no private keys to manage.

### Address Derivation

Wallet addresses are computed deterministically:

```
addressSeed = Poseidon(sub, app_salt)

walletAddress = calculateContractAddressFromHash(
  salt: addressSeed,
  classHash: cavosAccountClassHash,
  constructorCalldata: [addressSeed, jwksRegistryAddress, deployerAddress],
  deployer: 0x0
)
```

- **sub**: OAuth user ID (Google: `google-oauth2|123`, Firebase: `uid`)
- **app_salt**: Per-app salt (isolates wallets between apps)
- **Same user + Same app = Same wallet address**

## Authentication Methods

### OAuth Providers (Google/Apple)

- **Identity**: Email, name, profile picture
- **Verification**: JWT signed by provider's RSA keys
- **Recovery**: Login again with same account
- **Cross-device**: Same OAuth account = same wallet everywhere

### Email/Password (Firebase)

- **Identity**: Email (verified required)
- **Verification**: Custom JWT signed by Cavos with RSA-2048
- **Recovery**: Login with same email/password
- **Security**: Email verification prevents unauthorized access

### Passkey-Only

- **Identity**: Anonymous (no email)
- **Verification**: WebAuthn passkey
- **Recovery**: Device-based (iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager)
- **Privacy**: No personal information collected

## Gasless Transactions

All transactions through Cavos are **gasless by default**. Users never need to hold ETH.

### How It Works

1. User initiates a transaction via `execute()`
2. SDK signs with ephemeral key and sends to AVNU Paymaster
3. Paymaster sponsors the gas fee
4. Transaction is executed on-chain

### AVNU Paymaster

Cavos uses AVNU's paymaster infrastructure:

| Network | Paymaster | Cost |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Starknet Sepolia | Shared | Free |
| Starknet Mainnet | Per-app | Paid via dashboard |

## Account Abstraction (AA)

Starknet has native account abstraction, meaning every account is a smart contract. Cavos wallets use a **custom OAuth account contract**:

```
Account Class Hash: [OAuth Account with JWT verification]
```

### Account Features

- **JWT Verification**: On-chain RSA signature verification
- **Ephemeral Keys**: Lightweight signing after JWT registration
- **Self-Deploy**: Accounts deploy themselves via paymaster
- **Multi-call**: Execute multiple transactions atomically
- **Upgradeable**: Account logic can be upgraded

### Deployment

Accounts are deployed lazily on first transaction. Cavos handles this automatically:

1. Wallet address is computed deterministically from OAuth identity
2. Account can receive funds before deployment (precomputed address)
3. On first transaction:
   - Account deploys itself using JWT signature
   - Ephemeral key is registered on-chain
   - Transaction executes in same call
4. Subsequent transactions use lightweight ephemeral key signature

**Key Insight**: No relayer needed! The account deploys itself via paymaster using the JWT signature.

## Transaction Flow

### First Transaction (Deployment + Register)

```
User calls execute()
  ↓
SDK signs with ephemeral key
  ↓
Includes full JWT + RSA signature
  ↓
AVNU Paymaster builds transaction
  ↓
On-chain:
  1. Deploy account contract
  2. Verify JWT RSA signature
  3. Validate nonce matches ephemeral key
  4. Register ephemeral key
  5. Execute transaction
```

### Subsequent Transactions

```
User calls execute()
  ↓
SDK signs with ephemeral key
  ↓
Lightweight signature (no JWT)
  ↓
AVNU Paymaster sponsors gas
  ↓
On-chain:
  1. Verify ephemeral key signature
  2. Check key not expired
  3. Execute transaction
```

### Ephemeral Key Renewal

When ephemeral key expires:

```
SDK detects expiration
  ↓
Generates new ephemeral keypair
  ↓
Computes new nonce
  ↓
Signs with old ephemeral key + includes new JWT
  ↓
On-chain:
  1. Verify old ephemeral key (still valid in grace period)
  2. Verify JWT signature for new ephemeral key
  3. Register new ephemeral key
  4. Old key marked as replaced
```

## Authentication Flows

### OAuth (Google/Apple)

```
User → OAuth Login → JWT from Provider → Ephemeral Key Generated →
Wallet Address Derived → Ready to Transact
```

### Email/Password (Firebase)

```
User → Register + Verify Email → Login → Custom JWT from Cavos →
Ephemeral Key Generated → Wallet Address Derived → Ready to Transact
```

### Passkey-Only (Anonymous)

```
User → Passkey Registration → Anonymous Wallet Created →
WebAuthn Signature → Ready to Transact
```
